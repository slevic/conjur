## Unreleased

### Fixed
- Title of status page is now `Conjur Status` again, rather than only
  `Conjur` ([conjurinc/dap-support](https://github.com/conjurinc/dap-support/issues/75)).
- Policy load API endpoints now default to the `application/x-yaml` content-type
  if no content type is provided in the request
  ([conjurinc/dap-support#74](https://github.com/conjurinc/dap-support/issues/74)).
- The k8s authenticator correctly authenticates an app using the host ID to
  specify the k8s resource constraints and an annotation to specify the authenticator
  container name ([cyberark/conjur#1535](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur/issues/1535),
  [conjurinc/dap-support#79](https://github.com/conjurinc/dap-support/issues/79)).

### Changed
- Change ActiveSupport to use sha1 instead of md5

## [1.6.0] - 2020-04-14

### Changed
- Use Ubuntu 18.04 LTS as the base image for Conjur to continue using Ruby 2.5
  ([cyberark/conjur#1456](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur/issues/1456)).
- Conjur image now performs a `dist-upgrade` as the first image build step to
  ensure the image includes all available vulnerability fixes in the base OS.
- Upgrade from Rails 4 to Rails 5

## [1.5.1] - 2020-03-25

### Fixed
- Status page details section now displays the Conjur version number
  [cyberark/conjur#1438](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur/issues/1438).

## [1.5.0] - 2020-03-23

### Added
- Hosts can authenticate from Azure VMs using an Azure access token. See
  [design](design/authenticators/authn_azure/authn_azure_solution_design.md) for details
  ([conjurinc/appliance#927](https://github.com/conjurinc/appliance/issues/927)).

### Changed
- Lock rotators to prevent multiple rotations from incurring simultaneously.

### Fixed
- Fix support for using deployment as K8s authentication resource type for Kubernetes >= 1.16
  ([#1440](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur/issues/1440))

## [1.4.7] - 2020-03-12

### Changed
- Improved flows and rules around user creation (#1272)
- Kubernetes authenticator now returns 403 on unpermitted hosts instead of a 401 (#1283)
- Conjur hosts can authenticate with authn-k8s from anywhere in the policy branch (#1189)

### Fixed
- Updated broken links on server status page (#1341)

## [1.4.6] - 2020-01-21

### Changed
- K8s hosts' application identity is extracted from annotations or id. If it is
  defined in annotations it will taken from there and if not, it will be taken
  from the id.

## [1.4.5] - 2019-12-22

### Added
- Added API endpoint to enable and disable authenticators. See
  [design/authenticator_whitelist_api.md](design/authenticators/authenticator_whitelist_api.md)
  for details.

### Changed
- The k8s host id does not use the "{@account}:host:conjur/authn-k8s/#{@service_name}/apps"
  prefix and takes the full host-id from the CSR. We also handle backwards-compatibility and use
  the prefix in case of an older client.

## [1.4.4] - 2019-12-19

### Added
- Early validation of account existence during OIDC authentication
- Code coverage reporting and collection

### Changed
- Bumped `puma` from 3.12.0 to 3.12.2
- Bumped `rack` from 1.6.11 to 1.6.12
- Bumped `excon` from 0.62.0 to 0.71.0

### Fixed
- Fixed password rotation of blank password
- Fixed bug with multi-cert CA chains in Kubernetes service accounts
- Fixed build issues with creating namespaces with multiple values

### Removed
- Removed follower env configuration

## [1.4.3] - 2019-11-26

### Added
- Flattening of OSS container layers.

### Changed
- Upgraded Nokogiri to 1.10.5.
- Upgrade base image of OSS to `ubuntu:20.20`.
- Enablement work to get OSS container to work on OpenShift as-is.

## [1.4.2] - 2019-09-13

### Fixed
- An unset initContainer field in a deployment config pod spec will no
  longer cause the k8s authenticator to fail with `undefined method` ([#1182](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur/issues/1182)).

## [1.4.1] - 2019-06-24
### Fixed
- Make sure the authentication framework only caches Role lookups for the
  duration of a single request. Reusing stale lookups was leading to
  authentication failures.

## [1.4.0] - 2019-04-23
### Added
- Kubernetes authentication can now work externally from Kubernetes

### Changed
- Moved changelog validation up in CI pipeline

## [1.3.7] - 2019-03-27
### Changed
- Updated links to Policy & Cryptography reference in API documentation
- Updated conjur-policy-parser to
  [v3.0.3](https://github.com/conjurinc/conjur-policy-parser/blob/conjur-oss/CHANGELOG.md#v303).
- Replaced `changelog` entrypoint in `ci/test` with a separate script. Building
  the `conjur` and `conjur-test` images just to be able to install and run the
  `parse_a_changelog` gem seemed a little heavyweight.
- Renamed the old docs/ folder to design/

## [1.3.6] - 2019-02-19
### Changed
- Reduced IAM authentication logging
- Refactored authentication strategies

### Removed
- Removed OIDC APIs public access

## [1.3.5] - 2019-02-07
### Changed
- Rails version updated to v4.2.11.
- Updated Docker build to pre-compile Rails assets for Conjur image.

## [1.3.4] - 2018-12-19
### Changed
- Updated dependencies and Ruby version of Docker image
- Removed the cloudformation template in favor of the one found in the docs
  at https://docs.conjur.org/Latest/en/Content/Get%20Started/install-open-source.htm#h2-item-2

### Fixed
- Fixed the authn_restricted_to.feature so that it doesn't depend on the default docker
  network (172.0.0.0/8).
- Fixed Syslog formatting to properly escape the closing square bracket (]) per RFC 5424

## [1.3.3] - 2018-11-20
### Added
- Added support for secure LDAP connections in the LDAP authenticator.
- Added support to configure the LDAP authenticator with policy instead
   of environment variables.

## [1.3.2] - 2018-11-14
### Fixed
- Fixed request parameter parsing when creating or deleting a host factory token.
- Updated ffi and loofah dependencies to latest versions of each.

## [1.3.1] - 2018-10-19
### Fixed
- Fixed host factory `500` server response when a `Role` for a given host ID already
  exists but there is no corresponding `Resource` record.
- Improved authenticator error handling and logging.

## [1.3.0] - 2018-10-10
### Fixed
- Previously, loading a policy with a host factory that doesn't include
  any layers would cause a `nil` runtime exception. Now this case is checked
  specifically and raises a policy load error with a description of the problem.
- Added support for authenticators to implement `/login` in addition to `/authenticate`
- Implemented `/login` for `authn-ldap`.

## [1.2.0] - 2018-09-18

- Added support for issuing certificates to Hosts using CAs configured as
  Conjur services. More details are available [here](design/CERTIFICATE_SIGNING.md).
- Added support for Conjur CAs to use encrypted private keys
- Implemented keyword search for Role memberships
- Update Conjur issued certificates to include a SPIFFE SVID as a subject alternative
  name (SAN).

### Changed
- Change authn-k8s to expect the client cert (passed in `X-SSL-Client-Certificate`) to be
  url-escaped.
- Update Conjur issued certificates to use the common name derived from the authenticated
  host, rather than use the value from the CSR.

### Fixed
- Prevent anonymous (password-less) authentication with LDAP.

## [1.1.2] - 2018-08-22
### Fixed
- Substantial performance improvement when loading large policy files

### Security
- Fixes a vulnerability that could allow an authn-K8s request to bypass mutual TLS authentication. All Conjur users using authn-k8s within Kubernetes or OpenShift are strongly recommended to upgrade to this version.

## [1.1.1] - 2018-08-10
### Added

- Added variable rotation for Postgres databases
- Experimental audit querying engine mounted at /audit. It can be configured to work with
  an external audit database by using config.audit_database configuration entry.
- API endpoints for granting and revoking role membership
- API endpoint for the role graph
- Paging parameters (`offset` and `limit`) for audit API endpoints

### Changed
- RolesController#index now accepts `role` as a query parameter. If
  present, resources visible to that role are listed.
- Resources are now only visible if the user is a member of a role that owns them or has some
  permission on them.

  direct members of a role, without recursive expansion.

  of members of a Role.

### Added
- The first tagged version.
